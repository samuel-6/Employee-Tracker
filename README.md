# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was motivated by the need for businesses to have a streamlined way to manage their employees, roles, and departments. It offers a solution to the problem of keeping track of a large number of employees, their roles, departments, and who they report to. The Employee Tracker helps organize and plan a business, making it easier to view, add, and update employee data. Throughout this project, I learned about the importance of SQL databases in maintaining structured data and how to integrate a Node.js backend with a MySQL database for powerful data manipulation and management.
